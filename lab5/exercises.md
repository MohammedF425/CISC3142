**4.5: Determine the result of the following expressions.** <br>

```
(a) -30 * 3 + 21 / 5 = -86
(b) -30 + 3 * 21 / 5 = -18
(c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5 = 0
(d) -30 / 3 * 21 % 4 = -2

```

**4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment** <br>

*When using the prefix increment in an expression, the operand value is incremented and then the new value of the operand is returned. In postfix increment the operand value is incremented and then the old value of the operand is returned*

<br>

**4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions: ** <br>

```
(a) if (fval) -- fval is converted to a boolean
(b) dval = fval + ival; -- ival is converted to double
(c) dval + ival * cval; -- cval is converted to int, (ival * cval) is converted to double;

```
